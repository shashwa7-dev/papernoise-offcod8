# 🧻 PaperNoise

**Where pixels pretend to be paper.**

PaperNoise is a small experimental tool to create **vintage-style cards** with real textures, classic ink palettes, and old-school typography — entirely in the browser.

No templates. No AI fluff. Just code and texture obsession.

## ✨ Features

- Vintage / parchment-style card editor
- Custom paper, ink, and texture tint
- Image upload support
- High-quality PNG export
- Export-safe rendering using **dom-to-image-more**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React + Vite**
- **dom-to-image-more** (for high-fidelity exports)
- Vanilla CSS
- Base64 & SVG textures (no CORS issues)

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Constraints

- External image URLs may not export due to browser security
- Uploaded images are converted to base64 for reliability
- Textures are embedded to ensure consistent output

These are browser limitations, not bugs.
